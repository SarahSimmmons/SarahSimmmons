## Hi there 👋🏾

🌱 My name is Sarah Simmons, and I'm a Junior at Tufts University studying Computer Science. I'm passionate about developing my skills in Machine Learning and AI, Software Engineering, and Data Engineering. Feel free to explore my profile!

### Tech Stack
- Languages: C, C++, Java, Javascript, Python, SQL

### Key Projects
#### Dialogue Decoded
Explored and generated techniques to quantitatively measure which large language models people like best based on real conversation data.

### Extracurriculars
📚 I'm a member of the Tufts NSBE chapter (National Society of Black Engineers) and Tufts BSCS (Black Students in Computer Science). Off-campus, I'm taking part in the Break Through Tech AI Program at MIT, which has allowed me to expand my skills in Machine Learning and AI. Some other hobbies I have include sketching, reading, and dancing!
